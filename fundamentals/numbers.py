# There are 3 basics types of numbers in Python.

# int - whole numbers, positive or negative.  ex. 35
# float - decimal numbers, positive or negative.  ex. 4.2
# complex - are a part of the real number system and are often referenced with the letter j.  ex. 1 + 3j.  **Note** If you're not sure if you need to use them, it's safe to say you can ignore this data type.

#int
num = 10
#float
dec = 6.1
#log
print(num)
#type check
print (type(dec))
#conversion
num_to_dec = float(num)
